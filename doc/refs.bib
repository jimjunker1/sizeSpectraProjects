  abstract = {Species-rich communities exhibit higher levels of ecosystem functioning compared with species-poor ones, and this positive relationship strengthens over time. One proposed explanation for this phenomenon is the reduction of niche overlap among plants or animals, which corresponds to increased complementarity and reduced competition. In order to examine the potential of increased complementarity among plants or animals to strengthen the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions, we integrated models of bio-energetic population dynamics and food-web assembly. Through the simulation of various scenarios of plant and animal complementarity change, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed increases in (1) primary productivity, (2) control of herbivores by predators and (3) reduction of herbivore pressure on plants in species-rich communities. Our findings reveal that increased niche complementarity of plants can steepen the diversity--function relationships if it does not increase their intraspecific competition, while increasing complementarity among animals during community assembly can also have a positive effect but with considerable variability. The study highlights the importance of trait variation both among and within species and the interplay between intra- and interspecific competition strength in shaping the functioning of ecosystems over time. These results offer insights into the mechanisms underpinning the diversity--functioning relationship and have practical implications for ecosystem management and conservation efforts.

Our analyses of 50 lake and 48 forest soil communities show that, while species dissimilarity depends on environmental and spatial gradients, these effects are only weakly propagated to the networks. Moreover, our results show that species and food-web dissimilarities are consistently correlated, but that much of the variation in food-web structure across spatial, environmental, and species gradients remains unexplained. Novel food-web assembly models demonstrate the importance of biotic filtering during community assembly by (1) the availability of resources and (2) limiting similarity in species' interactions to avoid strong niche overlap and thus competitive exclusion. This reveals a strong signature of biotic filtering processes during local community assembly, which constrains the variability in structural food-web patterns across local communities despite substantial turnover in species composition.},

  abstract = {It is predicted that warmer conditions should lead to a loss of trophic levels, as larger bodied consumers, which occupy higher trophic levels, experience higher metabolic costs at high temperature. Yet, it is unclear whether this prediction is consistent with the effect of warming on the trophic structure of natural systems. Furthermore, effects of temperature at the species level, which arise through a change in species composition, may differ from those at the population level, which arise through a change in population structure. We investigate this by building species-level trophic networks, and size-structured trophic networks, as a proxy for population structure, for 18 648 stream fish communities, from 4 145 234 individual fish samples, across 7024 stream locations in France from 1980 to 2008. We estimated effects of temperature on total trophic diversity (total number of nodes), vertical trophic diversity (mean and maximum trophic level) and distribution of biomass across trophic level (correlation between trophic level and biomass) in these networks. We found a positive effect of temperature on total trophic diversity in both species- and size-structured trophic networks. We found that maximum trophic level and biomass distribution decreased in species-level and size-structured trophic networks, but the mean trophic level decreased only in size-structured trophic networks. These results show that warmer temperatures associate with a lower vertical trophic diversity in size-structured networks, and a higher one in species-level networks. This suggests that vertical trophic diversity is shaped by antagonistic effects of temperature on population structure and on species composition. Our results hence demonstrate that effects of temperature do not only differ across trophic levels, but also across levels of biological organisation, from population to species level, implying complex changes in network structure and functioning with warming.},

This assumption predicts a power-law distribution of the ISD, i.e., a linear relationship between size and abundance in log space. However, the secondary structure of ISD (nonlinear dome shape structures deviating from a power-law distribution) is often observed. We propose a model that extends the metabolic theory to link the secondary structure of ISD to the nonlinear size--TL relationship. This model is tested with empirical data collected from a subtropical reservoir. The empirical ISD and size--TL relationships were constructed by FlowCAM imaging analysis and stable isotope analyses, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the secondary structure of ISD can be predicted from the nonlinear function of size--TL relationship and vice versa. Moreover, these secondary structures arise due to (1) zooplankton omnivory and (2) the trophic interactions within microbial food webs.},

Here we fully parameterize a set of consumer--resource models for mammalian carnivores and successfully predict the size--density scaling relationship for this group without the use of free parameters. All models produced similar predictions, but comparison of nested models indicated that the primary factors generating size--density scaling in mammalian carnivores are prey productivity, predator--prey size ratios, and consumer area of capture.},

  abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels (vertical diversity, including food chain length and omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of complex ecosystems will benefit from integrating theory and experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

Concepts from these subdisciplines of ecology, specifically species compensation and ecosystem homeostasis, can be linked by analyzing the effect of changes in the abundance of species on ecosystem processes. Compensatory changes in species populations in response to environmental fluctuations can maintain an approximate steady state between rates of resource supply and resource consumption. We predict that ecosystem-level properties, such as species richness, total population, biomass, and energy use, will exhibit less variability in response to environmental change than will species composition. We tested this prediction using long-term data of a desert rodent community responding to natural environmental fluctuations and of a plant community responding to experimental manipulations. For the rodents, species composition was twice as variable as the ecosystem properties. This result was the same for both the analysis of variability around the 22-yr average and the analysis of variability from one time period to the next. For the plant communities, species composition was more variable among treatments in most years than stem count or species richness. Using the variance ratio proposed by J. L. Klug et al. we detected negative covariances in the rodent community, confirming the presence of compensatory dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recently, several studies have reported relationships between the abundance of organisms in an ecological community and their mean body size (called cross-community scaling relationships: CCSRs) that can be described by simple power functions. A primary focus of these studies has been on the scaling exponent (slope) and whether it approximates -3/4, as predicted by Damuth's rule and the metabolic theory in ecology. However, some CCSR studies have reported scaling exponents significantly different from the theoretical value of -3/4. Why this variation occurs is still largely unknown. The purpose of our commentary is to show the value of examining both the slopes and elevations of CCSRs and how various ecological factors may affect them. As a heuristic exercise, we reanalyzed three published data sets based on phytoplankton, rodent, and macroinvertebrate assemblages that we subdivided according to three distinctly different ecological factors (i.e., climate zone, season, and trophic level). Our analyses reveal significant variation in either or both the CCSR slopes and elevations for marine phytoplankton communities across climate zones, a desert rodent community across seasons, and saltwater lagoon macroinvertebrate communities across trophic levels. We conclude that achieving a comprehensive understanding of abundance-size relationships at the community level will require consideration of both slopes and elevations of these relationships and their possible variation in different ecological contexts.},

  abstract = {1 Mean body mass (W) and mean numerical (N) or biomass (B) abundance are frequently used as variables to describe populations and species in macroecological and food web studies. 2 We investigate how the use of mean W and mean N or B, rather than other measures of W and/or accounting for the properties of all individuals, can affect the outcome of tests of macroecological and food web theory. 3 Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that mean W, W at maximum biomass (Wmb), W when energy requirements are greatest (Wme) and the W when a species uses the greatest proportion of the energy available to all species in a W class (Wmpe) are not consistently related. 4 For a population at equilibrium, relationships between mean W and Wme depend on the slope b of the relationship between trophic level and W. For marine fishes, data show that b varies widely among species and thus mean W is an unreliable indicator of the role of a species in the food web. 5 Two different approaches, `cross-species' and `all individuals' have been used to estimate slopes of abundance--body mass relationships and to test the energetic equivalence hypothesis and related theory. The approaches, based on relationships between (1) log10 mean W and log10 mean N or B, and (2) log10 W and log10 N or B of all individuals binned into log10 W classes (size spectra), give different slopes and confidence intervals with the same data. 6 Our results show that the `all individuals' approach has the potential to provide more powerful tests of the energetic equivalence hypothesis and role of energy availability in determining slopes, but new theory and empirical analysis are needed to explain distributions of species relative abundance at W. 7 Biases introduced when working with mean W in macroecological and food web studies are greatest when species have indeterminate growth, when relationships between W and trophic level are strong and when the range of species'W is narrow.},

  abstract = {Body mass shapes processes from cell metabolism to community dynamics. Little is known, however, about how the average body mass of individuals varies among ecological communities. Ants alter colony mass by independently changing worker mass and/or worker number. In a survey of 49 ecosystems from tundra to tropical rainforest, average worker mass and worker number were uncorrelated (rs = 0.2, P {$>$} 0.14) and varied 100-fold. Data supported the hypothesis that higher mean monthly temperatures, T, reduce worker mass by increasing metabolic costs during worker development. In contrast, worker number was unimodal over a 1,000-fold gradient of net primary productivity (NPP, g of carbon per m2 per yr), a measure of organic carbon available to consumers. At the lowest levels of NPP colonies appeared to be carbon-limited; above 60 g of carbon per m2 per yr average worker number decreased to a global low. This decline in worker number with increasing NPP supports the hypothesis that abundant carbon ameliorates the Achilles heel of small taxa in competition with large taxa: their relatively high metabolic demands. Higher predation rates in resource-rich environments may also play a role in limiting worker number. In all, about half the global variation in worker mass and number was accounted for by gradients of NPP and T. Changes in global temperature and rainfall may thus mold gradients of ectotherm size, with consequences for the structure and function of the ecosystems.},

This 'scaling exponent' has been recalculated many times since, with some estimating the exponent to be close to 2/3 and others nearer to 3/4. A new analysis suggests that the relationship does not follow a straight line on a logarithmic scale, so is not a pure power law at all. Attempts to fit a straight line to what is really a curve produce 'scaling exponents' that are highly dependent on the data used. Data sets dominated by small organisms tend to produce exponents of 2/3 while those dominated by large organisms will produce 3/4.},

Here we show that the relationship between mass and metabolic rate has convex curvature on a logarithmic scale, and is therefore not a pure power law, even after accounting for body temperature. This finding has several consequences. First, it provides an explanation for the puzzling variability in estimates of p, settling a long-standing debate. Second, it constitutes a stringent test for theories of metabolic scaling. A widely debated model based on vascular system architecture fails this test, and we suggest modifications that could bring it into compliance with the observed curvature. Third, it raises the intriguing question of whether the scaling relation limits body size.},

In microbial ecology, a fruitful approach to large-scale questions is comparative analysis2,3 wherein statistical data patterns are sought from different ecosystems, frequently assembled from unrelated studies4. A more recent approach termed macroecology characterizes phenomena emerging from large numbers of biological units by emphasizing the shapes and boundaries of statistical distributions, because these reflect the constraints on variation5. Here, I use a set of flow cytometric measurements to provide macroecological perspectives on North Atlantic phytoplankton communities. Distinct trends of abundance in picophytoplankton and both small and large nanophytoplankton underlaid two patterns. First, total abundance of the three groups was related to assemblage mean-cell size according to the 3/4 power law of allometric scaling in biology6,7. Second, cytometric diversity8 (an ataxonomic measure of assemblage entropy) was maximal at intermediate levels of water column stratification9. Here, intermediate disturbance shapes diversity through an equitable distribution of cells in size classes, from which arises a high overall biomass. By subsuming local fluctuations, macroecology reveals meaningful patterns of phytoplankton at large scales.},

Using data from the North American Christmas Bird Count, we find that total abundance increases with productivity to the 0.61 power, and decreases with body mass and environmental temperature as predicted by metabolic theory when individuals are below their thermoneutral zone. We note a negative relationship between ambient temperature and average body mass, and suggest that this community-level pattern, reminiscent of Bergmann's Rule, is related to a tendency for small species to be lessabundant or absent from cold locations.

  abstract = {The density of organisms declines with size, because larger organisms need more energy than smaller ones and energetic losses occur when larger organisms feed on smaller ones. A potential expression of density-size distributions are Normalized Biomass Size Spectra (NBSS), which plot the logarithm of biomass independent of taxonomy within bins of logarithmic organismal size, divided by the bin width. Theoretically, the NBSS slope of multi-trophic communities is exactly {\`A}1.0 if the trophic transfer efficiency (TTE, ratio of production rates between adjacent trophic levels) is 10\% and the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) is fixed at 104. Here we provide evidence from four multi-trophic lake food webs that empirically estimated TTEs correspond to empirically estimated slopes of the respective community NBSS. Each of the NBSS considered pelagic and benthic organisms spanning size ranges from bacteria to fish, all sampled over three seasons in 1 yr. The four NBSS slopes were significantly steeper than {\`A}1.0 (range {\`A}1.14 to {\`A}1.19, with 95\% CIs excluding {\`A}1). The corresponding average TTEs were substantially lower than 10\% in each of the four food webs (range 1.0\% to 3.6\%, mean 1.85\%). The overall slope merging all biomass-size data pairs from the four systems ({\`A}1.17) was almost identical to the slope predicted from the arithmetic mean TTE of the four food webs ({\`A}1.18) assuming a constant PPMR of 104. Accordingly, our empirical data confirm the theoretically predicted quantitative relationship between TTE and the slope of the biomass-size distribution. Furthermore, we show that benthic and pelagic organisms can be merged into a community NBSS, but future studies have yet to explore potential differences in habitat-specific TTEs and PPMRs. We suggest that community NBSS may provide valuable information on the structure of food webs and their energetic pathways, and can result in improved accuracy of TTE-estimates.},

Here, we address this shortcoming by characterising the biomass structure of 141 freshwater, marine and terrestrial food webs, spanning a broad gradient in community biomass. We test whether sub-linear scaling between predator and prey biomass (a potential signal of density-dependent processes) emerges within ecosystem types and across levels of biological organisation. We find a consistent, sub-linear scaling pattern whereby predator biomass scales with the total biomass of their prey with a near {$\frac{3}{4}$}-power exponent within food webs - i.e. more prey biomass supports proportionally less predator biomass. Across food webs, a similar sub-linear scaling pattern emerges between total predator biomass and the combined biomass of all prey within a food web. These general patterns in trophic structure are compatible with a systematic form of density dependence that holds among complex feeding interactions across levels of organization, irrespective of ecosystem type.},

In aquatic ecosystems, particularly for benthic macroinvertebrates, the slope value deviates from the expected value of -0.75. This variation may depend on abiotic and biotic factors as well as methods that are used to sample benthic macroinvertebrates. ``Leaf-bags'' and ``Surber-net'' are the most used methods and they provide different data about the body size structures and abundance of the sampled benthic macroinvertebrates. Here, we used the slope of the body size--abundance relationships to compare the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages sampled with two sampling methods (Leaf-bags and Surber-net). We found that Leaf-bags sampled a greater number of smaller taxa than Surber-net, which collected individuals of larger sizes. In our study, differences in the benthic macroinvertebrate body size structures collected with these two sampling methods were evident even if the experiment was performed at a limited spatio--temporal scale. Therefore, Leaf-bags and Surber-net should be used as complementary rather than alternative techniques since they sample integrated information from the benthic macroinvertebrate communities.},

Recent theoretical advances in multispecies size spectrum models (MSSMs) predict that the emergence of ontogenetic diet shifts are driven primarily by size-selective predation and changes in the relative abundances of suitably sized prey. Howeverthese assumptions have not yet been tested with data. Herewe developed alternative MSSMs based on different assumptions about the nature of species and size-based preferences and tested them using an extensive dietary database for the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS). MSSMs with both size and species-specific prey preferences correctly predicted approximately three-fold more of the diet links than those that assumed fixed species preferences. Importantlythese model assumptions also had a profound effect on the strength of fishing-induced trophic cascades and the emergent trophic structure of the community with and without fishing. The diet-informed models exhibited lower predation mortality ratesparticularly for small individuals (less than 1 g) whichin turnreduced the intensity and reach of fishing-induced trophic cascades up the size spectrum. If the level and size dependency of piscivory observed in EBS predators is typical of other systemsthe potential for fishing-induced trophic cascades may be over-stated in MSSMs as they are currently formulated and parameterized. Representation of species-specific ontogenetic shifts in diet can strongly influence system responses to perturbationsand the extensions we propose should accelerate adoption of MSSMs as frameworks for exploring size-based food web theory and developing modeling tools to support strategic management decisions.},

Distributions of the sizes of species within an assemblage delineated by geography instead of taxonomy (all the species in a region regardless of clade) are much less studied but are equally important and will illuminate a different set of ecological and evolutionary processes.                                         We develop and test a mechanistic model of how diversity varies with body mass in marine ecosystems. The model predicts the form of the `diversity spectrum', which quantifies the distribution of species' asymptotic body masses, is a species analogue of the classic size spectrum of individuals, and which we have found to be a new and widely applicable description of diversity patterns.                                         The marine diversity spectrum is predicted to be approximately linear across an asymptotic mass range spanning seven orders of magnitude. Slope -0{$\cdot$}5 is predicted for the global marine diversity spectrum for all combined pelagic zones of continental shelf seas, and slopes for large regions are predicted to lie between -0{$\cdot$}5 and -0{$\cdot$}1. Slopes of -0{$\cdot$}5 and -0{$\cdot$}1 represent markedly different communities: a slope of -0{$\cdot$}5 depicts a 10-fold reduction in diversity for every 100-fold increase in asymptotic mass; a slope of -0{$\cdot$}1 depicts a 1{$\cdot$}6-fold reduction. Steeper slopes are predicted for larger or colder regions, meaning fewer large species per small species for such regions.                                         Predictions were largely validated by a global empirical analysis.                                         Results explain for the first time a new and widespread phenomenon of biodiversity. Results have implications for estimating numbers of species of small asymptotic mass, where taxonomic inventories are far from complete. Results show that the relationship between diversity and body mass can be explained from the dependence of predation behaviour, dispersal, and life history on body mass, and a neutral assumption about speciation and extinction.},

  abstract = {The population dynamics of animals involve a complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic regulation, characterized as population self-regulation, encompasses mechanisms that moderate growth rates before reaching maximum food-dependent densities. Conversely, extrinsically regulated populations are constrained by environmental variables such as food availability, predation, and disease. What regulates wolf populations has been debated for decades, with most publications concluding that wolves are extrinsically regulated, despite evidence of intrinsic mechanisms. This paper summarizes one perspective from a debate at the 'Wolves Across Borders' conference in Stockholm, Sweden in May 2023. Since this paper is a summary of a public debate, the paper is neither a review nor research paper, rather a research history and a recommendation on how the long-term disagreement might be resolved. Wolf population regulation is likely an interplay between both intrinsic and extrinsic factors which is best studied longitudinally by monitoring one population through time.},

  abstract = {Body size is a fundamental trait that impacts many aspects of species biology and ecology. It is, in turn, influenced by a suite of environmental factors, and often decreases with warming. Although environmental conditions can also impact body shape, which is another functional trait that influences locomotion, resource acquisition and potentially physiological processes, such responses are poorly understood and rarely quantified. We experimentally tested the independent and combined effects of environmental temperature, resource level and interspecific competition on the body shape and size responses of two model protist species. We also tested the degree to which these individual-level phenotypic responses are associated with population densities and species coexistence. Body shape was strongly influenced by resource competition, whereas body size changes were mainly driven by environmental temperature. In both species, lower resource levels resulted in body shape elongation, suggesting that relatively more elongate individuals with potentially higher swimming speed were advantaged in the resource scarce environment. However, competition had contrasting influence on the body shape of the two species. Competition decreased the population densities of Blepharisma japonicum, which exhibited relative body shape elongation, similar to the response at low resource levels. In contrast, competition increased the population densities of Paramecium aurelia, which exhibited reduced elongation similar to body shape response at high resource levels. Hence, body shape responses could be indicative of changes in resource availability, aiding our understanding of competitive hierarchies and species interactions. Coexistence was observed in all treatment combinations, likely because body size of both species decreased similarly under warming, potentially maintaining constant per capita competitive intensity. These findings, along with recent research on phytoplankton, diverse pelagic invertebrates, and birds highlight the importance of body shape and morphology across different taxonomic groups. Hence, we call for body size and shape to be considered in concert when investigating ecological consequences of climate warming.

  abstract = {One challenge in merging community and ecosystem ecology is to integrate the complexity of natural multitrophic communities into concepts of ecosystem functioning. Here, we combine food-web and allometry theories to demonstrate that primary production, as measured by the total nutrient uptake of the multitrophic community, is determined by vertical diversity (i.e. food web's maximum trophic level) and structure (i.e. distributions of species and their abundances and metabolic rates across trophic levels). In natural ecosystems, the community size distribution determines all these vertical patterns and thus the total nutrient uptake. Our model suggests a vertical diversity hypothesis (VDH) for ecosystem functioning in complex food webs. It predicts that, under a given nutrient supply, the total nutrient uptake increases exponentially with the maximum trophic level in the food web and it increases with its maximum body size according to a power law. The VDH highlights the effect of top--down regulation on plant nutrient uptake, which complements traditional paradigms that emphasised the bottom--up effect of nutrient supply on vertical diversity. We conclude that the VDH contributes to a synthetic framework for understanding the relationship between vertical diversity and ecosystem functioning in food webs and predicting the impacts of global changes on multitrophic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Resource limitation represents an important constraint on ecological communities, which restricts the total abundance, biomass, and community energy flux a given community can support. However, the exact relationship among these three measures of biological activity remains unclear. Here we use a simple framework that links abundance and biomass with an energetic constraint. Under constant energetic availability, it is expected that changes in abundance and biomass can result from shifts in the distribution of individual masses. We test these predictions using long-term data from a desert rodent community. Total energy use for the community has not changed directionally for 25 years, but species composition has. As a result, the average body size has decreased by almost 50\%, and average abundance has doubled. These results lend support to the idea of resource limitation on desert rodent communities and demonstrate that systems are able to maintain community energy flux in the face of environmental change, through changes in composition and structure.},

The physiological origins of Kleiber's law are still debated and generalizations of the law accounting for deviations from the scaling behavior have been proposed. Most theoretical and experimental studies of Kleiber's law, however, have focused on the relationship between the average body size of a species and its mean metabolic rate, neglecting intraspecific variation of these 2 traits. Here, we propose a theoretical characterization of such variation and report on proof-of-concept experiments with freshwater phytoplankton supporting such framework. We performed joint measurements at the single-cell level of cell volume and nitrogen/carbon uptake rates, as proxies of metabolic rates, of 3 phytoplankton species using nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and stable isotope labeling. Common scaling features of the distribution of nutrient uptake rates and cell volume are found to hold across 3 orders of magnitude in cell size. Once individual measurements of cell volume and nutrient uptake rate within a species are appropriately rescaled by a function of the average cell volume within each species, we find that intraspecific distributions of cell volume and metabolic rates collapse onto a universal curve.

  abstract = {The biodiversity of food webs is composed of horizontal (i.e. within trophic levels) and vertical diversity (i.e. the number of trophic levels). Understanding their joint effect on stability is a key challenge. Theory mostly considers their individual effects and focuses on small perturbations near equilibrium in hypothetical food webs. Here, we study the joint effects of horizontal and vertical diversity on the stability of hypothetical (modelled) and empirical food webs. In modelled food webs, horizontal and vertical diversity increased and decreased stability, respectively, with a stronger positive effect of producer diversity on stability at higher consumer diversity. Experiments with an empirical plankton food web, where we manipulated horizontal and vertical diversity and measured stability from species interactions and from resilience against large perturbations, confirmed these predictions. Taken together, our findings highlight the need to conserve horizontal biodiversity at different trophic levels to ensure stability.},
